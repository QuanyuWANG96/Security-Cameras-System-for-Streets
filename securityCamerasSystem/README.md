# Security Camera System
I used multithreading for three algorithms to solve the minimal vertex cover problem. One thread is CNF-SAT method and the other two threads are approximate algorithms. This program standout and stderror to screen, output the Approximate Ratio and Running Time to dictionary `runTime`. It is completed by Run Zeng and me together.

The analysis of the running time of three method, please [click report](https://github.com/QuanyuWANG96/Security-Cameras-System-for-Streets/blob/master/securityCamerasSystem/report.pdf).

# Execution

In order to run this program, please git clone Minisat package from https://github.com/agurfinkel/minisat.git

`ex` is shell script to run ece650-driver.cpp automatically.
